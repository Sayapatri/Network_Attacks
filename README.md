## Newtwork Attacks

A network attack is an attempt by an unauthorized user or hacker to disrupt the normal functioning of a computer network or to gain access to sensitive information stored within the network.


A botnet is a network of compromised computers or devices that are under the control of a malicious actor, often referred to as a botmaster or bot herder. These devices are typically infected with malware that allows the attacker to remotely control them without the user's knowledge or consent.

Botnets can be used for a variety of nefarious activities, including:

### Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks: 
A botnet can be used to launch DDoS attacks against a target, overwhelming their servers and rendering their services unavailable.

#### Spamming: 
Botnets can be used to send large volumes of spam emails, which can be used for phishing or other types of fraud.

#### Cryptocurrency Mining: 
Botnets can be used to mine cryptocurrency by using the computing power of the infected devices.

Botnets can be difficult to detect and dismantle, as they are often distributed across many different devices and networks. To protect against botnets, it's important to keep your devices and software up-to-date with the latest security patches, use strong and unique passwords, and be wary of suspicious emails and links. For this project we will be using Bonet as the DDoS Attack.
